Phonebook

Features Necessary:
1. Add new entry
2. Delete an entry
3. Search and Edit an entry
4. Search and display an entry
5. Display a range of entries
6. Display all the entries
7. A search function
8. Menu System
9. Save data to disk
10. load data from disk

Functions Necessary: (if we want to do a linkedlist)
1. Insert into LinkedList 
2. Delete from LinkedList
3. Search a LinkedList
4. Edit a node in a LinkedList
5. Display a node from a LinkedList
6. Display main/sub menus
7. An input function to take integers as input for menus and index inputs
8. A string function to take strings as input, returning a dynamic string, and a size_t var
9. A function to take a filepath and load the file into memory dynamically, performing the necessary formatting.
10. A function to save the data structure into a file with the necessary format.

Extra Features to consider:
-Adding Color to Terminal (very easy)
-Adding a different data structure (hashmap, tree) (harder) (if we do this we cannot do sorting, but searching will be faster)
-Implementing sorting (harder)
-Input validation (medium) (Phone numbers, postal codes are correctly formatted)
-Duplicate protection (easy)
-Partial Searches (searching 555 in phone numbers returns all phone numbers with that sequence of numbers) (medium)
-Add Version control (harder) (store recent changes in a file to recall the most recent changes)
-Add a birthday field and create a menu option for Upcoming birthdays (easy) (get current date and return all contacts within the range of 30 days

Code Structure so far:
-A double circular linkedlist - head points back to tail
-A struct that contains all data per entry
-Struct entries are all dynamic for dynamic string input
-Code is separated into two types - frontend and backend
-All backend functions will have unit tests
-Backend function handle interaction with systems like files and the linkedlist
-Frontend functions handle interactions the user and the backend
-Backend has two layers - raw and functional
-Raw backend handles the basics - adding, searching, sorting, displaying an entry by index, etc
-Functional uses multiple raw function to add a layer of functionality - editing combines searching, adding, and deleting for reusablilty


Functions Layout (so far) (subject to change):
1. Insert into LinkedList 
	-Inputs: 
		int index: if -1 append to tail
		struct node* newNode
		struct node* head
	-Returns true if passed; else false

2. Delete from LinkedList
	-Inputs: 
		int index:
		struct node* head
		size_t* count; gets decremented if deletion succeeded
	-Returns head no matter what

3. Search a LinkedList
	-Inputs:
		const char* string
		int field
		struct node* head
	-Returns -1 if not found and index if found
		
4. Edit a node in a LinkedList
	-Inputs: (search then display then create new node then add and then delete old node)
		const char* string
		int field
		struct node* head
	-returns true or false

5. Display a node from a LinkedList
	-Inputs:
		const char* string
		int field
		struct node* head
	-Returns true or false (prints the contact information)

6. Display main/sub menus

7. An input function to take integers as input for menus and index inputs

8. A string function to take strings as input, returning a dynamic string, and a size_t var

9. A function to take a filepath and load the file into memory dynamically, performing the necessary formatting.

10. A function to save the data structure into a file with the necessary format.
